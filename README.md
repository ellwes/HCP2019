# HCP2019 - Project

# Environment
At beskow change to the gnu environment:
module swap PrgEnv-cray PrgEnv-gnu

# Run non-blocking
The code for the non-blocking implementation can be found in the folder HeatEquation.
The name of the outfile and the matrix size are declared in src/main.c and can be change to appropriate values.

Compile with 
make
Run with
aprun -n <nr_nodes> ./bin/calc.out
The matrix are then printed to the outfile declared in src/main.c in binary.

## In order to create a plot
Open the read_plot.m script with matlab. Specify the file that should be printed. (Preferably generated by ./bin/calc.out).


# Run blocking
The code for the blocking implementation can be found in the folder Blocking
The name of the outfile and the matrix size are declared in src/main.c and can be change to appropriate values.

Compile with 
make
Run with
aprun -n <nr_nodes> ./bin/calc.out
The matrix are then printed to the outfile declared in src/main.c in binary.

## In order to create a plot
The script read_plot.m that are declared can be used in this case as well.
