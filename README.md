# HCP2019 - Project

## Environment
At beskow change to the gnu environment:
module swap PrgEnv-cray PrgEnv-gnu

## Run non-blocking
The code for the non-blocking implementation can be found in the folder HeatEquation.
The name of the outfile and the matrix size are declared in src/main.c and can be change to appropriate values.

Compile with 
```
make
```
Run with
```
aprun -n <nr_nodes> ./bin/calc.out
```
The matrix are then printed to the outfile declared in src/main.c in binary.

# Run blocking
The code for the blocking implementation can be found in the folder Blocking
The name of the outfile and the matrix size are declared in src/main.c and can be change to appropriate values.

Compile with 
```
make
```
Run with
```
aprun -n <nr_nodes> ./bin/calc.out
```
The matrix are then printed to the outfile declared in src/main.c in binary.

## Create a plot
Open the HeatEquation/read_plot.m script with matlab. Specify the file that should be printed. (Preferably generated by ./bin/calc.out).
